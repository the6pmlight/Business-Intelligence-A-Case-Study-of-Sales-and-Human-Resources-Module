Market Analysis

We can identify the countries that have the highest order counts. By analyzing this data, we gain insights into which regions are more active in placing orders and contributing to the company's sales.
It's possible to track the number of orders over different time periods, such as months or quarters. This analysis helps us understand the fluctuations and patterns in order volumes, potentially revealing seasonal trends or changes in customer behavior.
Through customer data available, we can classify customers into different age groups. This classification allows us to understand the distribution of customers across various age segments and provides insights into the demographic profile of the customer base.

Customer Analysis

This is a Dashboard analyzing customer data. In the first chart, statistics about the most profitable cities are presented, categorized by the ratio of male to female customers. It can be seen that the number of male and female customers does not exhibit significant differences. The map chart illustrates the customer density in various cities. It is evident that customers are fairly evenly distributed across different locations; however, customer density is notably higher in the United Kingdom compared to other places like France, Australia, and Germany. The next chart depicts customer numbers by age and marital status. This chart shows that there are more married customers compared to single ones. Particularly, there are more older customers (aged 51 to 80) who are married, as opposed to middle-aged customers (aged 37 to 50), which contrasts with the single customers. Finally, the chart illustrates the number of first-time customers over time. It's apparent that the number of customers gradually increased from early 2011 to the beginning of 2013, peaking in March 2013. This indicates that with each passing day, more people become aware of and trust the company's products, leading to purchases.

Product Analysis

With the Dashboard shown in the figure, this is an analysis report about products: Sales by Products, Avg Product Cost Per Category & Sub, Category Total Cost, Top 5 Products Cost. In the horizontal bar chart, Sales by Products represents the total revenue of each product. We can observe that the products generating the highest revenue are Bikes. The vertical bar chart, Avg Product Cost Per Category & Sub, clearly displays the relatively high costs of certain bikes, while Accessories and Clothing have negligible costs. Looking at the Top 5 Products Cost chart, it's evident that the top 5 most cost-intensive products are all Mountain Bikes. Finally, the pie chart illustrates the cost proportions of each Product category.
4.2.6. Currency Analysis

The figure above is a Dashboard presenting profit information by each currency type. At a glance, the majority of transactions are settled in US dollars, followed closely by Australian dollars and British pounds. Looking at the line chart depicting "Changing in Each Currency Profit Overtime" from 2011 to 2014, we can observe that over time, the US dollar is increasingly being used to settle bills. This is also easily understandable as the US dollar is a currency with stable value over an extended period.

Promotion Analysis

While examining the promotions data, we gain valuable insights into the duration of each promotion, the discount percentages offered, and the minimum and maximum quantity limits associated with each promotion.
This data allows us to understand the temporal aspect of promotions, helping us determine how long each promotion lasts. It also provides information about the discount rates applied during these promotions, shedding light on the potential cost savings for customers. Additionally, knowing the minimum and maximum quantities allowed under each promotion helps us grasp the scope and eligibility criteria of these offers.
Analyzing this information can offer insights into the effectiveness of different promotions, their popularity among customers, and their impact on sales. It can also help businesses strategize their promotional campaigns, making informed decisions on discount rates, promotion durations, and quantity limits.
